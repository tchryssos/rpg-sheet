## TODOs

### Architecture

1. Add more advanced query/fetch support ([React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) or [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/))
1. Use `getServerSideProps` for data fetching

### UX/UI

1. Pressing 'enter' on add another multiple fields should create a new field (what to do about text area?)
1. Adding another field should autofocus that field
1. Make everything hideable (i.e. individual inputs within a group or section). Record these states so they can be saved
1. Rearrange multi field inputs
1. Checkboxes need a re-design
1. Better button / icon tooltips
1. Dice rolling by clicking on attributes

### Other

1. Links to official resources?
