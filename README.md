## TODOs

1. BACKEND
1. Add a spell functionality rather than guessing at how many spells / level, etc
1. Pressing 'enter' on add another multiple fields should create a new field (what to do about text area?)
1. Adding another field should autofocus that field
1. Make everything hideable (i.e. individual inputs within a group or section). Record these states so they can be saved
1. Rearrange multi field inputs
1. Checkboxes need a re-design
1. Better button / icon tooltips
1. Links to official resources?
1. Dice rolling by clicking on attributes
