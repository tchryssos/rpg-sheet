# Character Sheets

## TODOs

1. BACKEND
1. Toolbar titles (should your character's name fill in once the input is off the form?)
1. Pressing 'enter' on add another multiple fields should create a new field (what to do about text area?)
1. Adding another field should autofocus that field
1. Make everything hideable (i.e. individual inputs within a group or section). Record these states so they can be saved
1. Fields with bonuses probably don't need an entire additional input for the bonus, nor does that data need to be saved (Maybe dispay the bonus "inside" the input?).
1. Rearrange multi field inputs
1. Checkboxes need a re-design
1. Better button / icon tooltips
1. Links to official resources?
